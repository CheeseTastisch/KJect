However, we would be very happy if you would first create an issue and discuss your idea with us.
Otherwise, it could happen that your pull request will be rejected.

### How to create a pull request
1. Fork the repository
2. Commit your changes
3. Push your changes to your fork
4. Create a pull request

Please notice that we trie to use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
This means that your commit messages should follow the following format:
```

```

For example:
```

```

The same applies to pull request titles.
